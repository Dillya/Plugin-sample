This is a simple example on how to use Dynamic libraries under Linux in C to create Plugin system.
This example uses some functions (in sdk.c) from the main progam (main.c) in the plugin (module.c).

# Compile and test

First of all, clone this git:

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/Dillya/Plugin-sample.git
cd Plugin-sample
</pre>

Then make and lauch program:

<pre>
make
./main
</pre>

The program will diplay "This is 27".
